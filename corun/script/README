Corun Instructions

1) Run the prog_gen.py in gpudb directory to get all the query programs in corun/query_progs
2) After runing prog_gen.py, all the solo run performance trace are in trace/file, if need it again, then use solorun.py
3) Corun: run corun.py and wait, all the corun trace will be stored in corun/output
4) After corun.py complete, run present_totaltime.py to analyze the trace in corun/output and get three files for plot : result_corun, speedup0, speedup1, and it will also generate plot_corun.plt
5) "gnuplot plot_corun.plt", get the speedup.png

6) If you want to corun just two queries, such as q1_1/q1_2, do "./testcorun.py q1_1 q1_2", their trace will be stored in corun/output/q1_1.q1_2, then you can replot the png.
7) Any error happens when running will be recoreded in the error file in each corun output directory, run "find_crush.py" to see which coruns are not successful.


IMPORTANT: 
1) Before corun, please modify the GMM_LOAD variable in prog_gen.py, corun.py, solorun.py, testcorun.py before using them to indicate the load library
2) When corun with libgmm, modify the Makefile in gpudb/cuda/src to use absolute path, so that the no matter where the query program is, it will find the right library.
